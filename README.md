# count-set-bits

## Goals

- Learn more about Redux
- Try out Vite
- Improve my TypeScript abilities
- Get used to writing tests (aka write some Jest tests)

## Inspiration

During a recent job search, I was tasked with writing a program that counted the number of set bits in an unsigned 8-bit integer
and I really enjoyed coming up with some of my own solutions and then diving deeper into some more sophisticated ones.

I came across Brian Kernighan's algorithm to count set bits in an integer and thought it was super neat and showcased
some cool and easy to understand usage of bitwise operators.

So I thought it would be cool to develop a sort of interactive and visual tool that people can use to learn more about how the algorithm works!

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner
